The hardest choice when starting out was never if I should learn to code but rather how I should learn to code. 

Do I buy the latest textbook? Watch the most popular YouTube coding channels? Enroll in a college computer science 101 course? Are bootcamps worth it?

But more importantly....

What language do I learn? Front-end or back-end or full-stack? Is web development different from software engineering? What about machine learning and data science?

   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I don't know.

But why not start here?
